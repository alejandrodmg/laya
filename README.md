Light chat-based personal assistant application that can be accessed from anywhere in the world as long as you have internet connection and a Telegram account (recommended documentation: https://core.telegram.org/bots).

The bot is designed to run fully on a Raspberry Pi to avoid deployment costs on web services.

It currently supports multiple features:

- Intention prediction.
- Feedback learning loop. 
- On-demand access to photo/video surveillance data using a PiCamera.
